# GameOfLife

Game of life came to me while riding in the car.  I should have it wrap around the screen.
Left to right and top to bottom.
On the Hackaday Supercon 2019 badge this becomes GOL4.
The first one that I made kept inside the confines of the screen.  It treated the edges
like they were physical barriers.  I saw that someone had made a Game Of Life that when the
living set was in motion it went off the bottom of the screen and started up on the top of
the screen.  I assumed that it also went from one side to the other.
